# Delta for spec-resolution

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: R-LSR-01: Local Spec Search
In Node.js environments, the resolver MUST recursively search the 'specs/' directory for the target spec name or versioned file. In browser environments, when a workspace handle is active, the resolver MUST search the workspace's local 'specs/' directory first before making any network requests. If found in either environment, it MUST load the local file.
(Previously: example paths cited the pre-flattening `v0.1.0/level2/...` shape; the search behavior itself is unchanged.)

#### Scenario: Spec file found in specs directory (Node.js)
- GIVEN the Node.js environment is active
- AND a spec file exists locally at 'specs/iNNfo_V_0-1-3_NN.md'
- WHEN the resolver requests the spec version 'V_0-1-3'
- THEN the resolver MUST load the local file 'specs/iNNfo_V_0-1-3_NN.md'
- AND the resolver MUST NOT initiate any network requests to fetch the spec

#### Scenario: Spec file found in workspace specs directory (Browser)
- GIVEN the browser environment is active with an active workspace handle
- AND a spec file exists in the workspace under 'specs/templates/business/business_V_0-1-0_NN.md'
- WHEN the resolver requests the template 'business_V_0-1-0'
- THEN the resolver MUST locate and load the file from the workspace handle
- AND the resolver MUST NOT initiate any network requests to fetch the spec

### Requirement: R-LSR-02: Network Fallback and Write-Once Persistence
If a spec is not found locally within the 'specs/' directory, the resolver MUST fetch it from the URL specified in 'parent_spec.url' and save the downloaded content into the same 'specs/' directory, under the document's own canonical versioned filename, so subsequent requests resolve it via R-LSR-01 (local search) without a repeat fetch. There is no separate cache directory: 'specs/' serves both hand-placed/vendored templates and anything a previous run already downloaded — the local search in R-LSR-01 is the only lookup step.

'specs/' content is immutable by convention (a version bump always produces a new filename under the flat `specs/` + `specs/templates/{name}/` layout, never an in-place edit — see the `spec-versioning` capability, R-SV-01/R-SV-02). Persisting a resolved spec is therefore write-once: if a file with the canonical filename already exists, the resolver MUST leave it untouched rather than overwrite it. This write-once rule is the entire integrity guarantee — because content is never silently replaced, there is nothing to hash-verify or expire.
(Previously: referenced an undefined "spec versioning changelog"; now cites the `spec-versioning` capability directly. The `v0.2.x`/`latest/` snapshot folders this rule used to protect are removed by that same capability.)

#### Scenario: Spec not found locally is fetched and saved into specs/
- GIVEN a spec version 'V_0-2-0' is not present in the 'specs/' directory
- AND the parent spec defines a fallback URL in 'parent_spec.url'
- WHEN the resolver requests the spec version 'V_0-2-0'
- THEN the resolver MUST fetch the spec content from the network using 'parent_spec.url'
- AND the resolver MUST save the downloaded content into 'specs/' under its own canonical versioned filename
- AND return the fetched spec content

#### Scenario: Previously-fetched spec is loaded on subsequent requests without a repeat fetch
- GIVEN a spec version 'V_0-2-0' was fetched and saved into 'specs/' by an earlier run
- WHEN the resolver requests the spec version 'V_0-2-0' again
- THEN the resolver MUST load the spec content directly from 'specs/' (via R-LSR-01)
- AND the resolver MUST NOT initiate a network request

#### Scenario: An existing specs/ file is never overwritten
- GIVEN a file already exists in 'specs/' under a spec's canonical versioned filename
- WHEN the resolver would otherwise fetch and save content under that same filename
- THEN the resolver MUST leave the existing file's content untouched
- AND MUST NOT overwrite it with newly-fetched content

#### Scenario: Unparseable content is a hard error, not a silent fallback
- GIVEN content resolved from any source (local file path, 'specs/', or network fetch)
- WHEN the content has no parseable YAML frontmatter block
- THEN the resolver MUST raise a resolution error immediately
- AND MUST NOT treat the content as a valid spec with empty/absent frontmatter
- AND MUST NOT silently fall through to another resolution step

### Requirement: R-LSR-03: Browser-safe Core Imports
The core build condition for the browser ('browser.ts' entry point) MUST NOT import Node.js native libraries ('node:fs', 'node:fs/promises', 'node:path') or the Node-based resolver.

#### Scenario: Browser entry point has no Node.js module imports
- GIVEN the 'browser.ts' entry point for the core module
- WHEN the module is compiled or analyzed for browser usage
- THEN there MUST NOT be any imports or references to 'node:fs', 'node:fs/promises', or 'node:path'
- AND there MUST NOT be any imports or references to the Node-based resolver

#### Scenario: Browser bundler compiles the core package successfully
- GIVEN the browser-safe core entry point 'browser.ts'
- WHEN a browser bundler compiles the package with browser targets
- THEN the compilation MUST succeed without throwing errors about missing Node.js polyfills or native modules

### Requirement: R-LSR-04: Local File URI and Absolute Path Resolution

In Node.js environments, when resolving a parent spec URL that uses the `file://` scheme or is formatted as an OS absolute file path, `resolver-node.ts` MUST read the file directly using local filesystem APIs (`readFile`) instead of sending an HTTP `fetch()` request.

#### Scenario: Parent spec URL with file:// scheme resolved locally

- GIVEN a `parent_spec.url` specified as a `file://` URI (e.g., `file:///path/to/spec.md`)
- WHEN the Node spec resolver attempts to load the parent spec
- THEN it MUST convert the URI to a local file path and read it via `readFile`
- AND it MUST NOT make an HTTP `fetch()` request

#### Scenario: Parent spec URL specified as OS absolute path resolved locally

- GIVEN a `parent_spec.url` specified as an OS absolute path (e.g., `C:/specs/parent.md` or `/usr/specs/parent.md`)
- WHEN the Node spec resolver attempts to load the parent spec
- THEN it MUST read the spec content directly from the local file system via `readFile`
- AND it MUST NOT make an HTTP `fetch()` request
