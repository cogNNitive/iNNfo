# Spec Versioning Specification

## Purpose

Immutable, filename-encoded versioning for L0/L1/L2 spec artifacts under a single
flat `specs/` tree, replacing the `specs/latest/` alias and the parallel
`v0.2.0`/`v0.2.1` snapshot folders. Makes the write-once guarantee in
`spec-resolution` R-LSR-02 structurally satisfiable: no spec artifact may ever be
addressed by a versionless or mutable path.

## Requirements

### Requirement: R-SV-01: Canonical Flat Spec Tree Layout

The `specs/` directory MUST contain L0 and L1 spec files directly at its root (no
`level0/`/`level1/` subfolders), and MUST group each L2 template under
`specs/templates/{template-name}/`, with that template's shipped samples under
`specs/templates/{template-name}/samples/`. No other top-level grouping (`latest/`,
`v0.2.0/`, `v0.2.1/`) may exist.

#### Scenario: L0 and L1 resolve at the specs/ root
- GIVEN the repository's `specs/` directory
- WHEN the resolver looks up the L1 iNNfo spec
- THEN it finds `specs/iNNfo_V_x-y-z_NN.md` directly under `specs/`, with no `level1/` segment

#### Scenario: L2 template and its samples share one folder
- GIVEN the `business` template at version `V_0-1-0`
- WHEN a consumer resolves the template or one of its shipped samples
- THEN both resolve under `specs/templates/business/` — the template file directly inside, samples inside `specs/templates/business/samples/`

### Requirement: R-SV-02: Filename-Encoded Immutable Versioning

Every file under `specs/` MUST encode its own version as a `V_x-y-z` segment in its
filename. A version bump MUST always create a new file; an already-published spec
file MUST NOT be edited in place or deleted while any model still references it.
This requirement extends `spec-resolution` R-LSR-02's write-once guarantee: because
every filename already carries its version, no versionless path can violate it.

#### Scenario: Bumping a template creates a new file, keeps the old one
- GIVEN `specs/templates/procedures/procedures_V_0-1-0_NN.md` is published and referenced by an existing model
- WHEN the template is bumped to `V_0-2-0`
- THEN `specs/templates/procedures/procedures_V_0-2-0_NN.md` is created as a new file
- AND `procedures_V_0-1-0_NN.md` remains unchanged and is not deleted

### Requirement: R-SV-03: `template_version` Field on L2 Templates

Every L2 template file MUST declare a `template_version` frontmatter field carrying
its own filename-encoded version, independent of `spec_version` (which
tracks L1 compliance, not template identity). `template_version` MUST change only
when the template's filename changes.

#### Scenario: Template declares its own version independent of the parent spec
- GIVEN a `business` template file compliant with L1 spec `V_0-1-0`
- WHEN the template is authored at its own third revision
- THEN its frontmatter declares both `spec_version: "V_0-1-0"` and `template_version: "V_0-1-2"`, differing independently

### Requirement: R-SV-04: `parent_spec` Remains a `{name, url}` Object

`parent_spec` on L3 models MUST remain a `{name, url}` object. It MUST NOT be
collapsed into a single URL string: independent consumers read `parent_spec.name`
for display without parsing `url`, and the validator/serializer require both
fields with distinct error paths.

#### Scenario: parent_spec keeps both fields after migration
- GIVEN an L3 model migrated to reference a new-layout template
- WHEN its frontmatter is inspected
- THEN `parent_spec` is an object with both `name` and `url`, not a bare string

### Requirement: R-SV-05: Reserved, Inert `specializes` Field

L2 templates MAY declare an optional `specializes` field naming a base template
for structural inheritance. This field is reserved and documented but MUST NOT be
interpreted or enforced by any resolver, validator, or mutation tool in this
change — it MUST remain a no-op, kept distinct from `template_version` so
specialization and versioning are never conflated.

#### Scenario: specializes is accepted but inert
- GIVEN a template file with `specializes: "business"` in its frontmatter
- WHEN the template is validated
- THEN validation passes without acting on `specializes`, and no template-inheritance logic is triggered

### Requirement: R-SV-06: Removal of Legacy and Orphan Spec Trees

`specs/latest/`, `specs/v0.2.0/`, `specs/v0.2.1/`, `specs/latest/INDEX.md`,
`specs/CHANGELOG.md`, and `models/specs/` MUST be deleted. The orphan L2 template
folders `businessV2/`, `cogNNitive/`, and `biz/` MUST be deleted outright — not
archived, not migrated into `specs/templates/`.

#### Scenario: No trace of the legacy trees remains
- GIVEN the migration has landed
- WHEN the repository is scanned for `specs/latest/`, `specs/v0.2.0/`, `specs/v0.2.1/`, or `models/specs/`
- THEN none of those paths exist

#### Scenario: Orphan templates are gone, not relocated
- GIVEN the migration has landed
- WHEN the full repository is searched for `businessV2/`, `cogNNitive/`, or `biz/` template folders
- THEN none exist anywhere, including under `specs/templates/`

### Requirement: R-SV-07: Atomic Single-Change Migration

The new `specs/` tree and the removal of the old trees (`specs/latest/`,
`specs/v0.2.0/`, `specs/v0.2.1/`, `models/specs/`) MUST land in the same
change/commit. No intermediate, reviewable, or merged state may contain both the
old and the new tree simultaneously.

#### Scenario: No commit has both trees present
- GIVEN the full commit history of the migration change
- WHEN each commit's file tree is inspected
- THEN no single commit contains both `specs/templates/` (new) and `specs/latest/` (old)

### Requirement: R-SV-08: L3 `parent_spec.url` Must Pin a Versioned Filename

An L3 model's `parent_spec.url` MUST resolve to a specific versioned template
filename (e.g., `specs/templates/business/business_V_0-1-2_NN.md`) and MUST NOT
point at a mutable alias such as a `latest/` path. Shipped samples MUST follow the
same rule.

#### Scenario: Shipped sample pins a versioned filename
- GIVEN the shipped sample `CodeReviewProcess_V_0-1-0_procedures_NN.md`
- WHEN its `parent_spec.url` is inspected
- THEN it points at a specific versioned file under `specs/templates/procedures/`, not at any `latest/` path

#### Scenario: A latest/ alias no longer resolves as a parent_spec.url target
- GIVEN a model whose `parent_spec.url` points at a path containing `specs/latest/`
- WHEN the model is validated after this migration lands
- THEN validation fails because no `specs/latest/` path exists in the repository to resolve against

### Requirement: R-SV-09: Adopted L1 Version Invariant

`apps/innfo-editor/src/utils/constants.ts` `DEFAULT_INNFO_VERSION` is the single
source of truth for the adopted Level-1 iNNfo format version. When it holds
`V_x-y-z`, the file `specs/iNNfo_V_x-y-z_NN.md` MUST exist, and that file's
frontmatter `status` MUST be `"Stable"` — a value drawn from `defiNNe`'s declared
`Draft | Stable | Deprecated` vocabulary. The adopted L1 spec file MUST NOT carry
`status: "Draft"`, and MUST NOT carry a value outside that vocabulary (in
particular not `"Active"`). Superseded L1 spec files are immutable (R-SV-02) and
keep whatever `status` they were published with.

#### Scenario: Adopted constant points at a Stable, existing L1 spec
- GIVEN `DEFAULT_INNFO_VERSION` is `V_0-2-0`
- WHEN the repository is inspected
- THEN `specs/iNNfo_V_0-2-0_NN.md` exists
- AND its frontmatter `status` is `"Stable"`

#### Scenario: Out-of-vocabulary status is rejected
- GIVEN a proposed `status` of `"Active"` on the adopted L1 spec file
- WHEN the adoption invariant is checked
- THEN it fails, because `"Active"` is not in the `Draft | Stable | Deprecated` vocabulary declared by the `defiNNe` version that spec points at

#### Scenario: Superseded L1 spec is left untouched
- GIVEN `V_0-2-0` is adopted
- WHEN `specs/iNNfo_V_0-1-0_NN.md` is compared to its pre-change state
- THEN it is byte-identical, still `status: "Draft"`

### Requirement: R-SV-10: Template-Set Completeness at the Adopted L1 Version

Every L2 template shipped under `specs/templates/` MUST have at least one template
file whose frontmatter `parent_spec.name` resolves to the adopted L1 version named
by `DEFAULT_INNFO_VERSION`. A template MAY additionally retain older-version
files; each such older file MUST stay frozen and unedited (R-SV-02). A
first-revision template file that is already L1-compliant MAY keep its older
`template_version` and `_V_0-1-0_` filename while declaring `spec_version` at the
adopted version (R-SV-03) — it needs no new file.

#### Scenario: Every template folder resolves at the adopted L1
- GIVEN `DEFAULT_INNFO_VERSION` is `V_0-2-0`
- WHEN each folder under `specs/templates/` is inspected
- THEN each has at least one file whose `parent_spec.name` is `iNNfo_V_0-2-0`

#### Scenario: Bumped template freezes its older sibling
- GIVEN `blank` gains `blank_V_0-2-0_NN.md`
- WHEN `blank_V_0-1-0_NN.md` is compared to its pre-change state
- THEN it is byte-identical (not edited in place)
- AND the new file differs from its source only in `spec_version`, `spec_url`, `parent_spec.name`, `parent_spec.url`, and `template_version`

#### Scenario: First-revision compliant template needs no new file
- GIVEN `analysis_V_0-1-0_NN.md` declares `spec_version: V_0-2-0` and was never published at V_0-1-0
- WHEN template-set completeness is checked
- THEN the invariant is satisfied without adding an `_V_0-2-0_` file

### Requirement: R-SV-11: Frozen-Reference Allow-List

The change MUST define an explicit allow-list of files permitted to reference a
superseded L1 version indefinitely. The allow-list MUST include: the immutable
superseded L1 spec file (`specs/iNNfo_V_0-1-0_NN.md`) and the L0 spec
(`specs/defiNNe_V_0-1-0_NN.md`); each template's frozen `_V_0-1-0_` file and its
`_V_0-1-0_` shipped samples; the composite `includes` URLs that point at a
frozen first-revision sub-template; released and historical sections of
`CHANGELOG.md`; everything under `openspec/changes/archive/**`; and legacy
FOLDER-mode `_F.md` fixtures. A "stale reference" is any `source`, `doc`,
`skill`, `test`, or active-`fixture` file NOT on the allow-list that treats a
superseded version as the current one. After the change, every
superseded-version reference outside the allow-list MUST be eliminated or
individually justified in the verify report. A "zero superseded-version matches"
CI gate MUST NOT be required, because frozen files match the version string
forever; the allow-list review is the gate.

#### Scenario: Frozen file may keep the old version forever
- GIVEN `specs/templates/procedures/procedures_V_0-1-0_NN.md`
- WHEN the residual-reference scan runs
- THEN its superseded-version references are accepted, because the file is on the allow-list

#### Scenario: Stale source assumption is a defect
- GIVEN a non-allow-listed source file that treats `V_0-1-0` as the current default version
- WHEN the residual-reference scan runs
- THEN the file is reported as a stale reference that MUST be fixed or justified

#### Scenario: A residual reference outside the allow-list is either fixed or justified
- GIVEN the verify phase finds a `doc` file citing the superseded version as current
- WHEN it is not on the allow-list
- THEN the verify report MUST either record it as fixed or carry an explicit per-file justification

### Requirement: R-SV-12: Cross-Repo Bundled-Template Fidelity

When an L2 template is bundled into a downstream skill in another repository
(today: `workspace_spec_NN` under `cogNNitive/actioNN/skills/nn-innfo/templates/`),
the bundled copy MUST be byte-identical to the canonical `specs/templates/` file
it is copied from. It MUST NOT contain divergent edits, legacy pre-`NN` grammar,
or a stale `spec_version`.

#### Scenario: Bundled copy matches canonical
- GIVEN `cogNNitive/actioNN/skills/nn-innfo/templates/workspace_spec_NN.md`
- WHEN it is compared to `iNNfo/specs/templates/workspace_spec_NN.md`
- THEN the two files are byte-identical

#### Scenario: Divergent bundled copy is a defect
- GIVEN a bundled template carrying `spec_version: V_1-0-0` and pre-`NN` field grammar
- WHEN bundled-template fidelity is checked
- THEN it fails until the file is re-synced verbatim from the canonical file
