 * `innfo-core`'s `resolveParentChain` inherit/override walk, generalized
 * from the level-based spec chain (defiNNe -> FORMAT -> template ->
 * instance) to node-nesting (root node -> ... -> target node) — see
 * design.md "Metamodel resolution" decision. `resolveParentChain` itself
 * is not reused directly: it is fs+network based (`node:fs/promises`,
 * `fetch`) and is excluded from format-core's `browser` build condition
 * that this in-browser app resolves against (see recursiveParser.ts note
 * on the same constraint for FS drivers).

/**
 * Resolves a node's effective metamodel by walking root -> node and merging
 * each ancestor's locally-declared `concepts`/`markers` (R9): a name
 * declared closer to the target node overrides the same name declared by
 * an ancestor further up the chain — mirroring `getSpecForLevel`'s
 * closest-wins resolution over the spec chain. Nodes without a local
 * metamodel (nested elements) contribute nothing and are transparent to
 * the walk.
 *
 * `taxonomy` follows a different rule than `concepts`/`markers`: it is a
 * coherent tree, not a bag of independently-keyed items, so it is resolved
 * by wholesale replacement rather than per-edge merge — the closest
 * ancestor with a non-empty taxonomy wins outright, same closest-wins
 * directionality as concepts/markers, just applied to the whole edge list
 * at once instead of per name.
 *
 * Template roots: if `allRootIds` is provided, every root-level node
 * (parentId === null) contributes its local metamodel to the result.
 * This makes template concepts (and, absent a closer taxonomy, template
 * taxonomy) from structural ghost roots available to child models that
 * reference them via parent_spec.
