# Projects Template

## A template for modeling projects, ordered phases, milestones, deliverables, sequential task dependency graphs (Gantt / CPM), risks, and RACI matrices

## Philosophy

The Projects Template is designed for modeling and tracking projects following PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) standards. It provides structured concepts to define overall project goals (`Project`), the ordered stages a project moves through (`Phases`), target milestones (`Milestone`), tangible outputs (`Deliverable`), work activities (`Task`) with sequence dependencies (`depends_on`, `duration`) for Gantt / Critical Path Analysis, risk logs (`Risk`), and team RACI accountability mapping (`Project roles`).

## Objectives

- Provide PMBOK-aligned concepts for project planning, execution, and tracking.
- Break the project lifecycle into ordered `Phases` with entrance/exit criteria and phase-level status.
- Support task dependency graphs (`depends_on`, `duration`) enabling Critical Path Method (CPM) calculations and Gantt chart generation.
- Decouple target milestones from physical deliverables and work activities.
- Enable RACI governance mapping via evaluable matrices (`task-roles matrix`).
- Maintain risk management with probability, impact, and mitigation fields linked to milestones (`risks-milestones matrix`).

## Specification

### Concepts

| Concept | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Project** | `text` | Project summary, goals, scope, and strategic context |
| **Phases** | `sequence` | Ordered stages the project moves through, with start/end dates and phase status |
| **Milestone** | `list` | Target dates and major checkpoints throughout the project lifecycle |
| **Deliverable** | `list` | Tangible or intangible work products produced by the project |
| **Task** | `list` | Sequential work items with status, priority, duration, and dependencies |
| **Risk** | `list` | Identified risks with impact, probability, and mitigation plans |
| **Project roles** | `list` | Functional project roles and stakeholders |

### Markers

| Marker | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `health` | Tracks execution health and status of project components |

### Matrices

| Matrix | Source → Target | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Task-Roles | Task → Project roles | RACI assignment (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) |
| Task-Deliverables | Task → Deliverable | Product creation (Creates, Modifies, Validates) |
| Risks-Milestones | Risk → Milestone | Risk impact mapping (Impacts, MitigatedIn) |

### Relationship Types

| Type | Enabled | Representation |
|---|---|---|
| Hierarchy | ✅ | index block (wikilinks) |
| Evaluable matrix | ✅ | Source→target RACI and impact tables |
| Graph edge | ❌ | Not applicable |
| Sequence | ✅ | Enabled via the `Phases` concept and Task `depends_on` / `duration` fields |

## Template

### Level 3 Model Template (Lightweight)

To create a project model, create a level 3 FILE mode document with:

```yaml
---
level: 3
parent_spec:
  name: "projects_V_0-2-0"
  url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cogNNitive/iNNfo/main/specs/templates/projects/projects_V_0-2-0_NN.md"
model_version: "V_1-0-0"
title: "<Project Title>"

## Project
Overall vision, objective, and executive summary of the project.

## Phases

### Summary
The distinct, ordered stages a project moves through — from framing to close-out — each with its own objectives, deliverables, and entrance/exit criteria.

### Description
"Phases" break the project lifecycle into a sequence of stages that structure planning, execution, and control. Typical stages are:

- Idea / Initiation: the project need is framed, the value it delivers is defined, sponsors and constraints are identified. This stage sets the foundation for everything that follows.

- Planning / Design: the approach is designed — scope, activities, resources, schedule, budget, and risk response. The plan aligns the work with the project's objectives.

- Implementation / Execution: the plan is put into action — the product or service is built, partnerships are established, and work packages are delivered. Success here is critical to the project's viability.

- Evaluation / Verification: performance is assessed against the plan — key indicators are tracked, results are analysed, and stakeholder feedback is gathered. This stage surfaces where the project is off course.

- Close-out / Evolution: the project is adjusted or wound down based on the evaluation — scope is re-baselined, lessons are captured, and outputs are handed over to operations.

Phases are ordered (`type:: sequence`); a project advances through them, and `Milestone` checkpoints are typically anchored inside a phase. Use `phase_status`, `start_date`, and `end_date` to track each stage.

### Methodologies
**Waterfall / Stage-Gate**
A sequential model where progress flows through defined phases (conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment, maintenance) with a review gate between each. It provides a structured, auditable path from start to finish.
**PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments)**
A process-based method organised into management stages, each with its own plan, controls, and end-stage assessment before the project board authorises the next stage.
**Agile Delivery**
An iterative approach where phases (Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Review) are revisited every increment in response to feedback, keeping the plan aligned with reality.
**Lean Startup (Build-Measure-Learn)**
Turns work into increments, measures the response, and decides whether to pivot or persevere — repeating the loop until product/market fit is reached.
**Design Thinking (Empathize-Define-Ideate-Prototype-Test)**
Starts from user needs, frames the problem, generates ideas, prototypes, and tests solutions, iterating as many times as necessary.
**Blue Ocean Strategy**
Sequences strategic moves — Reconstruct Market Boundaries, Focus on the Big Picture, Reach Beyond Existing Demand, Get the Strategic Sequence Right — developed by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne.

### Prompts
`Break the project into phases with clear objectives and deliverables for each.`
`Assign start/end dates and responsible teams to every phase.`
`Describe entrance and exit criteria required to move between phases.`
`Identify phase-specific risks and mitigation measures.`
`Outline phase review processes and stakeholder approval checkpoints.`

## Milestone
Key date checkpoints and gates marking significant progress points in the project schedule.

## Deliverable
Specific artifacts or outcomes that must be completed to achieve project goals.

## Task
Actionable work units. Use `depends_on` and `duration` to construct task dependency networks for Critical Path Method (CPM) calculations.

## Risk
Uncertain events that could negatively affect project goals, including probability, impact, and mitigation strategies.

## Project roles
Functional responsibilities and team positions mapped to tasks via RACI.
