# Projects Template

## A template for modeling projects, milestones, deliverables, sequential task dependency graphs (Gantt / CPM), risks, and RACI matrices

## Philosophy

The Projects Template is designed for modeling and tracking projects following PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) standards. It provides structured concepts to define overall project goals (`Project`), target milestones (`Milestone`), tangible outputs (`Deliverable`), work activities (`Task`) with sequence dependencies (`depends_on`, `duration`) for Gantt / Critical Path Analysis, risk logs (`Risk`), and team RACI accountability mapping (`Roles`).

## Objectives

- Provide PMBOK-aligned concepts for project planning, execution, and tracking.
- Support task dependency graphs (`depends_on`, `duration`) enabling Critical Path Method (CPM) calculations and Gantt chart generation.
- Decouple target milestones from physical deliverables and work activities.
- Enable RACI governance mapping via evaluable matrices (`task-roles matrix`).
- Maintain risk management with probability, impact, and mitigation fields linked to milestones (`risks-milestones matrix`).

## Specification

### Concepts

| Concept | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Project** | `text` | Project summary, goals, scope, and strategic context |
| **Milestone** | `list` | Target dates and major checkpoints throughout the project lifecycle |
| **Deliverable** | `list` | Tangible or intangible work products produced by the project |
| **Task** | `list` | Sequential work items with status, priority, duration, and dependencies |
| **Risk** | `list` | Identified risks with impact, probability, and mitigation plans |
| **Roles** | `list` | Functional project roles and stakeholders |

### Markers

| Marker | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `health` | Tracks execution health and status of project components |

### Matrices

| Matrix | Source → Target | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Task-Roles | Task → Roles | RACI assignment (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) |
| Task-Deliverables | Task → Deliverable | Product creation (Creates, Modifies, Validates) |
| Risks-Milestones | Risk → Milestone | Risk impact mapping (Impacts, MitigatedIn) |

### Relationship Types

| Type | Enabled | Representation |
|---|---|---|
| Hierarchy | ✅ | index block (wikilinks) |
| Evaluable matrix | ✅ | Source→target RACI and impact tables |
| Graph edge | ❌ | Not applicable |
| Sequence | ✅ | Enabled via Task `depends_on` / `duration` fields |

## Template

### Level 3 Model Template (Lightweight)

To create a project model, create a level 3 FILE mode document with:

```yaml
---
level: 3
parent_spec:
  name: "projects_V_0-1-0"
  url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cogNNitive/iNNfo/main/specs/templates/projects/projects_V_0-1-0_NN.md"
model_version: "V_1-0-0"
title: "<Project Title>"

# Concept Guidance Documentation

## Project
Overall vision, objective, and executive summary of the project.

## Milestone
Key date checkpoints and gates marking significant progress points in the project schedule.

## Deliverable
Specific artifacts or outcomes that must be completed to achieve project goals.

## Task
Actionable work units. Use `depends_on` and `duration` to construct task dependency networks for Critical Path Method (CPM) calculations.

## Risk
Uncertain events that could negatively affect project goals, including probability, impact, and mitigation strategies.

## Roles
Functional responsibilities and team positions mapped to tasks via RACI.
