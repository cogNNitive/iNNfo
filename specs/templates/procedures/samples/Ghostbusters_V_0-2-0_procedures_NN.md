# NN Work

## NN Work: Standard Ghost Containment Protocol
next:: [[Subterranean Containment Grid Shutdown Recovery]]
Standard operating procedure for responding to NYC spectral emergency calls, entrapping psychokinetic entities, and securing them inside the headquarters containment grid.

## NN Work: Emergency Call Triage
parent:: [[Standard Ghost Containment Protocol]]
step_type:: event
next:: [[Site PKE Scanning]]
input:: [[Client Emergency Intake Call]]
output:: [[Dispatch Ticket]]
tool:: [[Headquarters Dispatch Console]]
Janine Melnitz logs incoming calls, confirms commercial billing terms, and dispatches the Ecto-1 field crew.

## NN Work: Site PKE Scanning
parent:: [[Standard Ghost Containment Protocol]]
step_type:: task
next:: [[Proton Stream Target Lock]]
input:: [[Dispatch Ticket]]
output:: [[PKE Survey Map]]
tool:: [[PKE Meter]]
Dr. Egon Spengler scans the target location using the PKE Meter to measure psychokinetic energy intensity and locate spectral class-V entities.

## NN Work: Proton Stream Target Lock
parent:: [[Standard Ghost Containment Protocol]]
step_type:: task
next:: [[Muon Trap Deployment]]
input:: [[PKE Survey Map]]
output:: [[Class-V Entity Entrapment Beam]]
tool:: [[Proton Pack Particle Accelerator]]
Dr. Ray Stantz and Winston Zeddemore unholster particle throwers, fire proton streams, and hold the entity in a stable containment field.

## NN Work: Muon Trap Deployment
parent:: [[Standard Ghost Containment Protocol]]
step_type:: task
next:: [[Subterranean Facility Transfer]]
input:: [[Class-V Entity Entrapment Beam]]
output:: [[Sealed Ghost Trap Unit]]
tool:: [[Muon Ghost Trap]]
Dr. Peter Venkman slides the muon trap beneath the entrapped entity, steps on the foot pedal, and seals the entity inside the containment canister.

## NN Work: Subterranean Facility Transfer
parent:: [[Standard Ghost Containment Protocol]]
step_type:: task
input:: [[Sealed Ghost Trap Unit]]
output:: [[Vault Containment Log]]
tool:: [[High-Voltage Subterranean Containment Grid]]
The crew returns to headquarters, inserts the sealed trap into the containment vault access port, and opens the deposit valve.

## NN Work: Subterranean Containment Grid Shutdown Recovery
Emergency protocol executed in the event of an external grid power failure or Municipal Environmental Protection Agency intervention.

## NN Work: Emergency Alarm Intercept
parent:: [[Subterranean Containment Grid Shutdown Recovery]]
step_type:: event
next:: [[Backup Generator Coupling]]
input:: [[Power Failure Alarm]]
output:: [[System Fault Diagnostic]]
tool:: [[Grid Status Warning Panel]]
Detection of voltage drop in the subterranean vault, triggering immediate audio-visual alarms across headquarters.

## NN Work: Backup Generator Coupling
parent:: [[Subterranean Containment Grid Shutdown Recovery]]
step_type:: task
input:: [[System Fault Diagnostic]]
output:: [[Restored High-Voltage Grid]]
tool:: [[Auxiliary Diesel Generator]]
Manual engagement of the auxiliary diesel power coupling to maintain grid containment pressure and prevent catastrophic spectral release.
