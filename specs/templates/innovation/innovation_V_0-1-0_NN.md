# Innovation Template

## A template for modeling corporate innovation portfolios with programs, people, opportunities, and initiatives

## Philosophy

The iNNfo Innovation Template models an innovation portfolio: strategic programs that govern opportunities (potential initiatives) and initiatives (execution workstreams), staffed by people. It follows the four-level flow Program → Opportunity → Initiative, with governance matrices linking people to both opportunities and initiatives.

## Objectives

- Model an innovation portfolio with four core concepts: Program, Person, Opportunity, and Initiative.
- Govern opportunities and initiatives through strategic programs with clear objectives, scope, funding, and reporting.
- Prioritize opportunities with `priority` and `certainty` markers before execution.
- Link people to opportunities and initiatives via evaluable governance matrices.

## Specification

### Concepts

| Concept | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Program** | `text` | The governing innovation program: objectives, scope, funding, governance, reporting |
| **Person** | `list` | People involved across the portfolio (sponsors, managers, team members, collaborators) |
| **Opportunity** | `list` | A potential initiative idea, evaluated and prioritized before execution |
| **Initiative** | `list` | An active execution workstream with budget, results, decisions, and risks |

### Markers

| Marker | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `priority` | Strategic priority score (1–10) |
| `certainty` | Confidence level (1–10) |

### Matrices

| Matrix | Source → Target | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| program-initiatives | Program → Initiative | Program governance over initiatives |
| opportunity-initiative | Opportunity → Initiative | Which opportunity an initiative addresses |
| person-initiative | Person → Initiative | Person involvement in initiatives (Sponsors/Manages/Participates) |
| person-opportunity | Person → Opportunity | Person role on opportunities (Proposes/Champions/Evaluates) |

### Relationship Types

| Type | Enabled | Representation |
|---|---|---|
| Hierarchy | ✅ | index block (wikilinks) |
| Evaluable matrix | ✅ | Source→target governance tables |
| Graph edge | ❌ | Not applicable |
| Sequence | ✅ | Enabled via opportunity-to-initiative and lifecycle stages |

## Template

### Level 3 Model Template (Lightweight)

To create an innovation portfolio model, create a level 3 FILE mode document with:

```yaml

level: 3
parent_spec:
  name: "innovation_V_0-1-0"

# Concept Guidance Documentation

## Program

### Summary

The governing innovation program: a single strategic container defining objectives, scope, funding sources, governance bodies, and reporting cadence for the whole portfolio.

### Description

A Program holds the strategic frame of an innovation portfolio. It declares the mission and strategic objectives, the scope of what the program covers, the indicators used to measure success, the governance structure (boards and committees) that makes decisions, the funding model, the lifecycle stages an initiative passes through, and the default statuses and types available to opportunities and initiatives.

### Methodologies

**Portfolio Management** — aligns the set of initiatives with the program's strategic objectives and measures aggregate outcomes.
**Stage-Gate Process** — routes each initiative through the program's lifecycle stages with governance checkpoints.

### Prompts

`Summarize the strategic objectives, scope, and success indicators of the innovation program.`
`Describe the governance structure, reporting cadence, and funding model of the program.`
`List the lifecycle stages, default opportunity statuses, and default initiative types used by the program.`

## Person

### Summary

A person involved across the portfolio (sponsor, manager, team member, or external collaborator) with identity, role, and profile details.

### Description

A Person represents any individual involved in the portfolio. Each person carries an identifier, name, role, and optionally a profile URL and image. Persons are linked to opportunities (as proposer, champion, or evaluator) and to initiatives (as sponsor, manager, or participant) through the governance matrices.

### Methodologies

**RACI** — clarify which person is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, or Informed for each initiative.

### Prompts

`Describe each person's role, responsibility, and how they participate across opportunities and initiatives.`
`Map each person to the opportunities they propose or champion and the initiatives they sponsor or manage.`

## Opportunity

### Summary

A potential initiative idea that is identified, evaluated, and prioritized before entering execution as an initiative.

### Description

An Opportunity is an idea captured for consideration. It describes a problem or market trend, the stakeholders involved, and the proposer. Each opportunity is scored with a priority and tracked through a status lifecycle (Identified → Under Review → Feasibility Studied → Prioritized → Archived). When an opportunity is prioritized, it is addressed by one or more initiatives.

### Methodologies

**Opportunity Scoring** — score each opportunity on priority and certainty to build a ranked portfolio.
**Idea Funnel** — progressively triage ideas from Identified through Prioritized before execution.

### Prompts

`Describe the problem or market trend this opportunity addresses, its stakeholders, and its proposer.`
`Score the opportunity's priority and certainty, and state its current status in the lifecycle.`
`Identify which initiatives address this opportunity once it is prioritized.`

## Initiative

### Summary

An active execution workstream that addresses an opportunity, with budget, results, learnings, decisions, next steps, and risks.

### Description

An Initiative is the execution unit of the portfolio. It links to the opportunity it addresses and the person who manages it. It carries the problem, proposed solution, value proposition, solution hypothesis, goals, and a measurable objective, plus results, learnings, an explicit decision (e.g. Persevere / Pivot / Stop), next steps, budget, resources, and risks. Each initiative passes through the program's lifecycle stages.

### Methodologies

**Hypothesis-Driven Execution** — validate a stated solution hypothesis against a measurable objective before scaling.
**Decision Gates** — record an explicit Persevere / Pivot / Stop decision with justification at each milestone.

### Prompts

`Describe the initiative's solution hypothesis, measurable objective, and goals.`
`Summarize the results, learnings, and the explicit decision (Persevere / Pivot / Stop) with justification.`
`List the next steps, budget, resources, and key risks of the initiative.`
