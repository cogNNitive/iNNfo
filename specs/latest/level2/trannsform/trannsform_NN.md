# traNNsform Template

## A provenance and lineage template that registers the sources ingested and the artifacts and models produced by the traNNsform pipeline, with explicit derivation edges

## Philosophy

The traNNsform template treats ingestion and generation as a lineage graph rather than a folder of loose files. It follows the W3C PROV model: **Sources**, **Models**, and **Artifacts** are entities; **Procedures** are activities; and derivation is recorded as explicit directed edges (`derived_from`, `generated_by`) rather than inferred from folder layout. This makes every generated deliverable auditable back to the exact raw inputs and the run that produced it.

## Objectives

1. Give a stable identity (content hash + name) to every raw Source ingested by traNNsform, and carry its normalized Markdown as a file-backed asset.
2. Register every produced Model and Artifact as a first-class entity with explicit derivation edges to its inputs.
3. Record the Procedure (activity) that generated each Model or Artifact, so runs are reproducible.
4. Keep all lineage edges as reference fields (PROV-style), not matrices, so they stay sparse, directional, and engine-validated.
5. Retire the terms "dashboard" and "export": every generated deliverable is an **Artifact**; its kind is a field value.

## Specification

The template instantiates the four root primitives of the Metaplantilla Nivel 1: **Concept Definition**, **Field Definition**, **Marker Definition**, and **Matrix Definition**. Its schema is resolved from the body elements of this document, not from frontmatter blocks.

### Concepts

| Concept | PROV role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Sources** | Entity | A raw input file ingested and normalized (hash, name, format, normalized content). |
| **Models** | Entity | A level-3 domain model produced from Sources. |
| **Artifacts** | Entity | A derivative deliverable (document, report, board, dataset) produced from Sources and/or Models. |
| **Procedures** | Activity | The transformation run that produced a Model or Artifact. |

### Lineage mechanism (why references, not matrices)

Lineage is **sparse and directional**, so it is modeled with `reference` fields — the iNNfo analog of PROV `wasDerivedFrom` / `wasGeneratedBy` and OpenLineage `inputs` / `outputs`:

- `Models.derived_from` → Sources
- `Models.generated_by` → Procedures
- `Artifacts.derived_from_inputs` → Sources and/or Models
- `Artifacts.produced_by` → Procedures

Because Sources, Models, Artifacts, and Procedures all live in this one provenance model, these edges are **intra-model references**, which the engine validates today. Evaluable matrices are reserved for **dense N×M** relations within a model and there are **no cross-model matrices** in iNNfo; the optional `Artifact-Source Lineage` matrix is only a projection view of the reference fields.

The derivation graph is a **DAG, not a fixed chain**: an Artifact may derive from a Model, directly from Sources, or both. Do not assume a fixed `Source → Procedure → Model → Artifact` order — record each entity's immediate inputs and let the graph be what it is.

### Cross-model note (implementation caveat)

`Models.model_ref` points at the actual domain model file. iNNfo supports qualified cross-workspace references (`Model :: Name`), but the reference **validator currently checks intra-model references only** — persisted cross-model reference validation is not yet implemented in `innfo-core`. Until it is, keep `model_ref` as a Markdown link / path (or the model `title`) rather than relying on a validated `Model :: Name` reference.

### Element / claim-level provenance

Provenance **within** a domain model (which Source backs a specific Element) is intentionally out of scope for this template, because a domain Element can only carry fields its own template declares. Fine-grained, claim-level provenance stays in the existing citation mechanism (`<!-- cite: src-NNN -->` + visible source) used in drafts and artifacts. A domain template MAY later opt in to a `source` reference field on its concepts.

### Markers

| Marker | Symbol | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `verified` | `>` | Human-verified provenance record (hash and derivation confirmed). |

### Relationship Types

| Type | Enabled | Representation |
|---|---|---|
| Hierarchy | ✅ | index block (wikilinks) |
| Evaluable matrix | ✅ | Optional `Artifact-Source Lineage` projection |
| Graph edge | ❌ | Not applicable (lineage uses reference fields) |
| Sequence | ❌ | Not applicable |

## Template

### Level 3 Model Template (Lightweight)

A traNNsform provenance model is one model per workspace, named `<Workspace>_V_x-y-z_trannsform_NN.md` and listed in the workspace `index.md`:

```yaml

The application resolves `parent_spec` to this template and uses its Concept, Field, Marker, and Matrix Definitions to validate and render the provenance model.

## Examples

### Canonical Sample

A sample provenance model should live at `specs/latest/level2/trannsform/samples/` exercising all four concepts, the `derived_from` / `generated_by` edges, and a file-backed `normalized_content` asset.

### Parent Chain

```yaml
# A provenance model's parent:

  name: "trannsform_V_0-1-0"
  url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cogNNitive/iNNfo/main/specs/latest/level2/trannsform/trannsform_NN.md"

# Concept Guidance Documentation

## Sources

### Summary
One raw input file that was ingested and normalized to Markdown by traNNsform.

### Description
A Source is the origin entity of the lineage graph. Its identity is the content hash (`raw_hash`), which is stable across renames and re-runs. The `normalized_content` field is file-backed: the Markdown that traNNsform previously wrote under `md/` becomes the Source element's asset, stored at `{modelDir}/assets/{element-slug}/{filename}`. Optionally the original binary is retained via `raw_file` for full reproducibility. All fields map 1:1 to the source-traceability frontmatter that the traNNsform scanner already emits.

## Models

### Summary
A level-3 iNNfo domain model produced from one or more Sources.

### Description
A Model entity is the provenance-side stand-in for a domain model file (business, organization, procedures, etc.). It carries the derivation edges (`derived_from` Sources, `generated_by` Procedure) and points at the real file through `model_ref`. Keeping the Model as an entity here lets Artifacts reference it with a validated intra-model reference instead of an unvalidated cross-model one.

## Artifacts

### Summary
A derivative deliverable produced from Sources and/or a Model.

### Description
An Artifact is any generated deliverable — a document, a report, a board (the term that replaces "dashboard"), or a dataset. The word "export" is retired: everything traNNsform generates is an Artifact, and its kind is the `artifact_format` field. Each Artifact records its immediate inputs (`derived_from_inputs`) and the Procedure that produced it (`produced_by`), closing the audit trail back to the raw Sources.

## Procedures

### Summary
The transformation run (activity) that produced a Model or Artifact.

### Description
A Procedure is the PROV activity of the lineage graph. It links to a reusable procedure spec under `procedures/` (`procedure_ref`), names the executing `agent`, and timestamps the run (`run_at`). Models and Artifacts reference the Procedure that generated them, making a run reproducible from its declared inputs, tool, and spec.
